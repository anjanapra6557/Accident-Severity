# Accident-Severity
I created a machine learning model that uses a variety of models, including KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and more, to predict the severity of accidents.


These are the implemented steps:

1. Data Preparation: Importing necessary dataset
2. Data Cleaning: Ensuring data integrity by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and applying Label Encoding.
3. Data Segregation: Separating features (x) from labels (y).
4. Train-Test Division: Splitting the data to facilitate accurate model assessment.
5. Data Standardization: Ensuring equitable treatment through StandardScaler.
6. Model Development: Creating predictive models using KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Booster, etc.
7. Performance Metrics: Evaluating the model's performance through measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Outcome:

Effectively engineered a strong machine learning model for predicting accident severity, showcasing exceptional accuracy.


Technologies Used:

Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
Colab IDE for development and experimentation
